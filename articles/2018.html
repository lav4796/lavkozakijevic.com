    <h1>What I've Read in 2018</h1>
  
    <p>First came the realization that I have been reading more in the last three years 
        than in any year before. Next, came the question: what did I read? 
        A compilation of titles started to form, beginning the quest to locate 
        all of the books I’ve <i>purchased</i> in that time, and then sorting out those 
        that I have actually read.</p>
  
    <p>It dawned upon me that in those previous years, and in fact many more years before, 
        I have had read zero books in my mother tongue. All were in English. 
        Some I possessed in their physical form, ordering them from online vendors. 
        Others were read on my phone’s 4-inch screen. Kindle in the house was a game changer.</p>

    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <p>The practice of marking interesting words and sentences began with underlining them. From the start it felt as desecration, from the aesthetic point of view. Then came brackets. Seemed to be more returning-reader-friendly. Still, imperfect and painful to the eye. Anxiety that I might like the book, feel compelled to give it to someone only for their enjoyment to be tainted, forced me to change my wicked ways. At the moment of typing this, asterisk is the solution. A mark on the margin, easily detectable yet discreet.</p>

    <p>Upon finishing a book, a pause ensues, and after a few days I return to the it 
        in order to extract those marked sentences. In 2017 they were typed down 
        in a file on HDD. That HDD perished. Now they are being typed down in a file 
        which is both offline and on a cloud-based service. Fingers crossed.</p>

    <p>Began using Notion as an individual this year, a wonderful app for 
        tracking many things including to read / reading / read / memoed lists of books.</p>
    
    <p>As many have, I’ve been taught to <i>respect</i> the author by going cover-to-cover, 
        no word left behind. Thankfully, it was the long dread of an uncompleted book 
        that was finally pulverized by people who led me to observe books as tools, 
        not as a deity. The practice of focused skimming ensued, after realizing 
        whether the author whose work I am reading has a knack for fluff.</p>

    <p>Finally, having decided to actually publish this instead of keeping it to myself (without notes), in no specific order:</p>

    <p>Thinking of a gift for a high school student? Look no further. 
        Received it as a gift from <a href="https://x.com/isaacmorehouse">Isaac Morehouse</a>. 
        Placed it on a shelf presuming that its mostly financial-self-help-mumbo-jumbo. 
        Absolutamente no! 
        Changes the lens on how to make long-term choices, and as such is especially useful 
        for those who are just about to break through their most comfortable years.</p>

            then false wealth is the accumulation of finite resources in the hope of satisfying infinite desires.</p>
